ContentResolver, Cursor
- queries user device for audio files 

MediaPlayer 
- plays audio

MediaController 
- controls playback

Android project c++ support?

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
- let music playback continue when the user's device becomes idle

activity launchMode="singleTop"
- If an instance of the activity already exists at the top of the target task, the system routes the intent to that instance through a call to its onNewIntent() method, rather than creating a new instance of the activity.

For all new visitors who find errors as mentioned below is due to the the new versions of Android (M and N as of now).

Solution:
First add this in Mainfest:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

Then add this in Main Activity just after 'setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)';
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
if (checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
!= PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

requestPermissions(new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE},1);

// MY_PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is an
// app-defined int constant

return;
}}

- results in build errors (package "" does not exist)
-- android.os.Build
-- android.Manifest
-- android.content.pm.PackageManager

player = new MediaPlayer();
player.setAudioStreamType(...) [method deprecated]

Play music in the Service class but control music from the Activity class
- Interaction between Activity and Service classes
-- Binder instance required 

MainActivity.onStart()
- overriden to start the Service instance when Activity starts
-- new intent
-- bind service 
-- start service

MusicService.onUnbind() 
- stops the service when user presses the 'end' button

*** res/menu/main.xml not inflated ***

*** onClick() not implemented ***
- causes app to crash

onRequestPermissionsResult(...)
- Callback for the result from requesting permissions 
- method is invoked for every call on requestPermissions(android.app.Activity, String[], int)
